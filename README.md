## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Hooray! Welcome to my first project :)  
For this project, however seemingly simple, the major challenge presented to me was:
  1.  Knowing how to center the elements; and,
  2.  Building a responsive design.
Most, I got by with trial-and-error, especially with the CSS margin, flex, padding properties (to center the elements); and CSS width and height properties (to make a responsive design)
There are still lots to improve with my coding skills, and this is just the start.
From here, I will further research on CSS properties so that I may be able to center properties and build a responsive design by my own.

Thanks for reading!
